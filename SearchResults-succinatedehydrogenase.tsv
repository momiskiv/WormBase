IPR044148	Succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase GabD1-like	"This entry represents a domain found in a group of succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenases, including SSADH1 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Sad from Escherichia coli. Succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase 1 (SSADH1 or GabD1) catalyzes the NADP(+)-dependent oxidation of succinate semialdehyde (SSA) to succinate. SSADH activity in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is encoded by both gabD1 (Rv0234c) and gabD2 (Rv1731). The Mtb GabD1 SSADH1 reportedly is an enzyme of the gamma-aminobutyrate shunt, which forms a functional link between two TCA half-cycles by converting alpha-ketoglutarate to succinate [[cite:PUB00095191]]. Sad catalyses the NAD+-dependent oxidation of succinate semialdehyde to succinate. It acts preferentially with NAD as cosubstrate but can also use NADP [[cite:PUB00095192], [cite:PUB00095193]].

Proteins containing this domain also includes Aldh from Paenarthrobacter nicotinovorans. Aldh does not display succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase activity. Instead, it acts as an aldehyde dehydrogenase involved in the oxidative D-xylose degradation pathway. It Is able to use both NAD+ and NADP+; however, it shows a preference for NADP+ [[cite:PUB00095194]]."	INTERPRO

PF03937	Flavinator of succinate dehydrogenase	This family includes the highly conserved mitochondrial and bacterial proteins Sdh5/SDHAF2/SdhE. Both yeast and human Sdh5/SDHAF2 interact with the catalytic subunit of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex, a component of both the electron transport chain and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Sdh5 is required for SDH-dependent respiration and for Sdh1 flavination (incorporation of the flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor). Mutational inactivation of Sdh5 confers tumor susceptibility in humans [[cite:PUB00066692]]. Bacterial homologues of Sdh5, termed SdhE, are functionally conserved being required for the flavinylation of SdhA and succinate dehydrogenase activity. Like Sdh5, SdhE interacts with SdhA. Furthermore, SdhE was characterised as a FAD co-factor chaperone that directly binds FAD to facilitate the flavinylation of SdhA. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that SdhE/Sdh5 proteins evolved only once in an ancestral alpha-proteobacteria prior to the evolution of the mitochondria and now remain in subsequent descendants including eukaryotic mitochondria and the alpha, beta and gamma proteobacteria [[cite:PUB00066693]].  This family was previously annotated in Pfam as being a divergent TPR repeat but structural evidence has indicated this is not true.

IPR007992	Succinate dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] cytochrome b small subunit, CybS	"This family consists of mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] cytochrome b small subunit CybS (also known an SQR) and import inner membrane translocase subunit Tim18.  Members of this subfamily are classified as Type C SQRs because they contain two transmembrane subunits and one heme group.  CybS and CybL are the two transmembrane proteins of eukaryotic SQRs. They contain heme and quinone binding sites. CybS is the eukaryotic homologue of the bacterial SdhD subunit.



CybS is a membrane-anchoring subunit of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) that is involved in complex II of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and is responsible for transferring electrons from succinate to ubiquinone (coenzyme Q) [[cite:PUB00038975]].  CybS is composed of a flavoprotein catalytic subunit, an iron-sulfur protein and one or two hydrophobic transmembrane subunits [[cite:PUB00038975]].  The two-electron oxidation of succinate in the flavoprotein active site is coupled to the two-electron reduction of quinone in the transmembrane subunits via electron transport through FAD and three iron-sulfur centres [[cite:PUB00080937]].  The reversible reduction of quinone is an essential feature of respiration, allowing transfer of electrons between respiratory complexes.  Mutations in human Complex II result in various physiological disorders including hereditary paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma tumors. The gene encoding for the SdhD subunit is classified as a tumor suppressor gene [[cite:PUB00080935], [cite:PUB00080936], [cite:PUB00080938]].



In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Tim18 is a component of the TIM22 complex, a complex that mediates the import and insertion of multi-pass transmembrane proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane. The TIM22 complex forms a twin-pore translocase that uses the membrane potential as external driving force. Its role in the complex is unclear but it may be involved in the assembly and stabilisation of the TIM22 complex [[cite:PUB00062970], [cite:PUB00062971], [cite:PUB00062972]]."	INTERPRO

cd07078	NAD(P)+ dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase family	The aldehyde dehydrogenase family (ALDH) of NAD(P)+ dependent enzymes, in general, oxidize a wide range of  endogenous and exogenous aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes to their corresponding carboxylic acids and play an  important role in detoxification. Besides aldehyde detoxification, many ALDH isozymes possess multiple additional catalytic and non-catalytic functions such as participating in  metabolic pathways, or as  binding proteins, or as osmoregulants, to mention a few. The enzyme has three domains, a NAD(P)+ cofactor-binding domain, a catalytic domain, and a bridging domain; and the active enzyme  is generally either homodimeric or homotetrameric. The catalytic mechanism is proposed to involve cofactor binding, resulting in a conformational change and activation of an invariant catalytic cysteine nucleophile. The cysteine and aldehyde substrate form an oxyanion thiohemiacetal intermediate resulting in hydride transfer to the cofactor and formation of a thioacylenzyme intermediate. Hydrolysis of the thioacylenzyme and release of the carboxylic acid product occurs, and in most cases, the reduced cofactor dissociates from the enzyme. The evolutionary phylogenetic tree of ALDHs appears to have an initial bifurcation between what has been characterized as the classical aldehyde dehydrogenases, the ALDH family (ALDH) and extended family members or aldehyde dehydrogenase-like (ALDH-like) proteins.

The α-helical ferredoxin domain is present in several proteins involved in redox reactions, including the C-terminal of the respiratory proteins succinate dehydrogenase (SQR) in bacteria/mitochondria, and fumarate reductase (QFR) in bacteria. SQR is analogous to the mitochondrial respiratory complex II, and is involved in the electron transport pathway from succinate as a donor to the acceptor ubiquinone. SQR helps prevent the formation of reactive oxygen species and is used during aerobic respiration, whereas QFR does not and, consequently, is used to catalyse the final step of anaerobic respiration using the acceptor fumarate [[cite:PUB00013184]].

In Escherichia coli fumarate reductase, subunits FrdA (FAD-containing catalytic subunit, or flavoprotein, &lt;dbxref db=""PIRSF"" id=""PIRSF000171""/&gt;) and FrdB ([Fe-S]-cluster-containing electron transfer subunit, &lt;dbxref db=""PIRSF"" id=""PIRSF000176""/&gt;) form a hydrophilic catalytic component, while FrdC (&lt;dbxref db=""PIRSF"" id=""PIRSF000180""/&gt;) and FrdD (&lt;dbxref db=""PIRSF"" id=""PIRSF000179""/&gt;) constitute a transmembrane anchor [[cite:PUB00015659], [cite:PUB00015147]]. FrdC and FrdD anchor the catalytic subunits to the membrane and are required for the enzyme to interact with quinones [[cite:PUB00015812], [cite:PUB00015147]]. The genes encoding the four QFR subunits in Escherichia coli are organized in the &lt;i&gt;frd&lt;/i&gt; operon. FrdA and FrdB are homologous with the corresponding subunits of succinate dehydrogenase (encoded by the &lt;i&gt;sdh&lt;/i&gt; genes). Generally, SQRs and QFRs can be divided into three functional subclasses based on the quinone substrate and the in vivo function of the enzyme [[cite:PUB00015792], [cite:PUB00015643]]. Subclass 1 contains enzymes that oxidize succinate and reduce a high-potential quinone (e.g. ubiquinone, caldariella quinone). The SQRs from mammalian mitochondria (respiratory complex II) and many prokaryotes belong to this group. Subclass 2 includes enzymes that catalyse oxidation of a low-potential quinol (e.g. menaquinol, rhodoquinol) and reduction of fumarate. All QFRs studied so far belong to this subclass. Subclass 3 includes enzymes that catalyse oxidation of succinate and reduction of a low-potential quinone (e.g. menaquinone, thermoplasma quinone), which is an energetically unfavourable reaction. Subclass 3 enzymes are found in Gram-positive bacteria and archaea [[cite:PUB00015792], [cite:PUB00015643]].Nomenclatu"	PIRSF
IPR010960	Flavocytochrome c	This entry describes a family of redox proteins related to the succinate dehydrogenases and fumarate reductases (FRDs) of Escherichia coli, mitochondria, and other well-characterised systems. A member of this family from Shewanella frigidimarina (strain NCIMB 400) is characterised as a water-soluble periplasmic protein with four haem groups, a non-covalently bound FAD, and essentially unidirectional fumarate reductase activity. At least seven distinct members of this family are found in Shewanella oneidensis, a species able to use a wide variety of pathways for respiration, whose physiological reductant is unknown. Proteins with the FRD-like domain architecture are widely distributed among various bacteria that comprise a new type of water-soluble NADH:fumarate oxidoreductases. NADH:fumarate oxidoreductase (or FRD) from Klebsiella pneumoniae catalyses the anaerobic reduction of fumarate to succinate using NADH as the inherent electron donor [[cite:PUB00097229]]. This entry includes Urocanate reductase (urdA) from Shewanella oneidensis, which catalyses the two-electron reduction of urocanate to dihydrourocanate and contains a FAD-binding domain homologous to the FAD-binding domains of succinate dehydrogenase and periplasmic fumarate reductase [[cite:PUB00097228]].

TIGR02061	adenylyl-sulfate reductase subunit alpha	During dissimilatory sulfate reduction or sulfur oxidation, adenylylsulfate (APS) reductase catalyzes reversibly the two-electron reduction of APS to sulfite and AMP [1]. Found in several bacterial lineages and in Archaeoglobales, APS reductase is a heterodimer composed of an alpha subunit containing a noncovalently bound FAD, and a beta subunit containing two [4Fe-4S] clusters [1]. Described by this model is the alpha subunit of APS reductase, sharing common evolutionary origin with fumarate reductase/succinate dehydrogenase flavoproteins.	NCBIFAM

This model identifies proteins that cluster as L-aspartate oxidase (a flavoprotein difficult to separate from the set of closely related flavoprotein subunits of succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase) by both UPGMA and neighbor-joining trees. The most distant protein accepted as an L-aspartate oxidase (NadB), that from Pyrococcus horikoshii, not only clusters with other NadB but is just one gene away from NadA.	NCBIFAM
cd08190	Hydroxyacid-oxoacid transhydrogenase (HOT) involved in gamma-hydroxybutyrate metabolism	This family contains hydroxyacid-oxoacid transhydrogenase (HOT), also known as D-2-hydroxyglutarate transhydrogenase. It catalyzes the conversion of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) to succinic semialdehyde (SSA), coupled to the stoichiometric conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to D-2-hydroxyglutarate in gamma-Hydroxybutyrate catabolism. Unlike many other alcohols, which are oxidized by NAD-linked dehydrogenases, gamma-hydroxybutyrate is metabolized to succinate semialdehyde by hydroxyacid-oxoacid transhydrogenase which does not require free NAD or NADP; instead, it uses alpha-ketoglutarate as an acceptor, converting it to d-2-hydroxyglutarate. Alpha-ketoglutarate serves as an intermediate acceptor to regenerate NAD(P) required for the oxidation of GHB. HOT also catalyzes the reversible oxidation of a hydroxyacid obligatorily coupled to the reduction of an oxoacid, and requires no cofactor. In mammals, the HOT enzyme is located in mitochondria, and is expressed with an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence. HOT enzyme is member of the metal-containing alcohol dehydrogenase family. It typically contains an iron although other metal ions may be used.

IPR009152	Cytochrome bc1 complex, cytochrome c subunit	"Quinol-cytochrome c reductases (also called the cytochrome bc1 complex) constitute a large family of enzymes which transfer electrons from quinols to cytochrome c, translocating protons across membranes in the process. They function in bacterial and mitochondrial repiratory chains, and also the photosythetic electron transfer chains of bacteria and plastids. These enzymes share a common functional core consisting of cytochrome b, a Reiske Fe-S protein, and cytochrome c.

Actinobacteria such as Mycobacteria or Corynebacteria possess a branched aerobic respiratory chain in which electrons flow from NADH dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase complexes into the menaquinone-menaquinol pool, from where they are transferred either to an aa3-type cytochrome c oxidase via the cytochrome bc1 complex, or to the cytochrome bd-type menaquinol oxidase; the latter important for microaerobic respiration [[cite:PUB00081475]]. In these bacteria the aa3-type cytochrome c oxidase and the cytochrome bc1 complex form a supercomplex [[cite:PUB00035558]].

divided into several subgroups depending upon the physiological nature of the
iron-sulfur cluster(s). One of these subgroups are the 4Fe-4S ferredoxins,
which are found in bacteria and which are thus often referred as
'bacterial-type' ferredoxins. The structure of these proteins [[cite:PUB00003399]] consists of
the duplication of a domain of twenty six amino acid residues; each of these
domains contains four cysteine residues that bind to a 4Fe-4S center.

Several structures of the 4Fe-4S ferredoxin domain have been determined (see

4S-tetrahedra forming a cubane-like structure, in such a way that the four
iron occupy the eight corners of a distorted cube. Each 4Fe-4S is attached to
the polypeptide chain by four covalent Fe-S bonds involving cysteine residues.

A number of proteins have been found [[cite:PUB00001503]] that include one or more 4Fe-4S
binding domains similar to those of bacterial-type ferredoxins. These proteins

   3Fe-4S  and a 4Fe-4S.

   to be an  iron-sulfur  protein  with  two ferredoxin-like domains in the N-

IPR015929	Aconitase B, swivel	"Aconitase (aconitate hydratase; [intenz:4.2.1.3]) is an iron-sulphur protein that contains a [4Fe-4S]-cluster and catalyses the interconversion of isocitrate and citrate via a cis-aconitate intermediate. Aconitase functions in both the TCA and glyoxylate cycles, however unlike the majority of iron-sulphur proteins that function as electron carriers, the [4Fe-4S]-cluster of aconitase reacts directly with an enzyme substrate. In eukaryotes there is a cytosolic form (cAcn) and a mitochondrial form (mAcn) of the enzyme. In bacteria there are also 2 forms, aconitase A (AcnA) and B (AcnB). Several aconitases are known to be multi-functional enzymes with a second non-catalytic, but essential function that arises when the cellular environment changes, such as when iron levels drop [[cite:PUB00036013], [cite:PUB00036014]]. Eukaryotic cAcn and mAcn, and bacterial AcnA have the same domain organisation, consisting of three N-terminal α/β/α domains, a linker region, followed by a C-terminal 'swivel' domain with a β/β/α structure (1-2-3-linker-4), although mAcn is smaller than cAcn. However, bacterial AcnB has a different organisation: it contains an N-terminal HEAT-like domain, followed by the 'swivel' domain, then the three α/β/α domains (HEAT-4-1-2-3) [[cite:PUB00005471]]. Eukaryotic cAcn enzyme balances the amount of citrate and isocitrate in the cytoplasm, which in turn creates a balance between the amount of NADPH generated from isocitrate by isocitrate dehydrogenase with the amount of acetyl-CoA generated from citrate by citrate lyase. Fatty acid synthesis requires both NADPH and acetyl-CoA, as do other metabolic processes, including the need for NADPH to combat oxidative stress. The enzymatic form of cAcn predominates when iron levels are normal, but if they drop sufficiently to cause the disassembly of the [4Fe-4S]-cluster, then cAcn undergoes a conformational change from a compact enzyme to a more open L-shaped protein known as iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1; or IRE-binding protein 1, IREBP1) [[cite:PUB00036018], [cite:PUB00036019]]. As IRP1, the catalytic site and the [4Fe-4S]-cluster are lost, and two new RNA-binding sites appear. IRP1 functions in the post-transcriptional regulation of genes involved in iron metabolism -it binds to mRNA iron-responsive elements (IRE), 30-nucleotide stem-loop structures at the 3' or 5' end of specific transcripts. Transcripts containing an IRE include ferritin L and H subunits (iron storage), transferrin (iron plasma chaperone), transferrin receptor (iron uptake into cells), ferroportin (iron exporter), mAcn, succinate dehydrogenase, erythroid aminolevulinic acid synthetase (tetrapyrrole biosynthesis), among others. If the IRE is in the 5'-UTR of the transcript (e.g. in ferritin mRNA), then IRP1-binding prevents its translation by blocking the transcript from binding to the ribosome. If the IRE is in the 3'-UTR of the transcript (e.g. transferrin receptor), then IRP1-binding protects it from endonuclease degradation, thereby prolonging the half-life of the transcript and enabling it to be translated [[cite:PUB00036021]].
IRP2 is another IRE-binding protein that binds to the same transcripts as IRP1. However, since IRP1 is predominantly in the enzymatic cAcn form, it is IRP2 that acts as the major metabolic regulator that maintains iron homeostasis [[cite:PUB00036012]]. Although IRP2 is homologous to IRP1, IRP2 lacks aconitase activity, and is known only to have a single function in the post-transcriptional regulation of iron metabolism genes [[cite:PUB00036015]]. In iron-replete cells, IRP2 activity is regulated primarily by iron-dependent degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasomal system.
Bacterial AcnB is also known to be multi-functional. In addition to its role in the TCA cycle, AcnB was shown to be a post-transcriptional regulator of gene expression in Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica [[cite:PUB00036016], [cite:PUB00036017]]. In S. enterica, AcnB initiates a regulatory cascade controlling flagella biosynthesis through an interaction with the ftsH transcript, an alternative RNA polymerase sigma factor.  This binding lowers the intracellular concentration of FtsH protease, which in turn enhances the amount of RNA polymerase sigma32 factor (normally degraded by FtsH protease), and sigma32 then increases the synthesis of chaperone DnaK, which in turn promotes the synthesis of the flagellar protein FliC.  AcnB regulates the synthesis of other proteins as well, such as superoxide dismutase (SodA) and other enzymes involved in oxidative stress. This entry represents the 'swivel' domain of bacterial aconitase B (AcnB) that is located in the N-terminal region following a HEAT-like domain. HEAT-like domains are usually implicated in protein-protein interactions, while the 'swivel' domain is usually a mobile unit in proteins that carry it. In AcnB, this N-terminal region was shown to be sufficient for dimerisation and for AcnB binding to mRNA. An iron-mediated dimerisation mechanism may be responsible for switching AcnB between its catalytic and regulatory roles, as dimerisation requires iron while mRNA binding is inhibited by iron."

IPR015933	Aconitase B, HEAT-like domain	"Aconitase (aconitate hydratase; [intenz:4.2.1.3]) is an iron-sulphur protein that contains a [4Fe-4S]-cluster and catalyses the interconversion of isocitrate and citrate via a cis-aconitate intermediate. Aconitase functions in both the TCA and glyoxylate cycles, however unlike the majority of iron-sulphur proteins that function as electron carriers, the [4Fe-4S]-cluster of aconitase reacts directly with an enzyme substrate. In eukaryotes there is a cytosolic form (cAcn) and a mitochondrial form (mAcn) of the enzyme. In bacteria there are also 2 forms, aconitase A (AcnA) and B (AcnB). Several aconitases are known to be multi-functional enzymes with a second non-catalytic, but essential function that arises when the cellular environment changes, such as when iron levels drop [[cite:PUB00036013], [cite:PUB00036014]]. Eukaryotic cAcn and mAcn, and bacterial AcnA have the same domain organisation, consisting of three N-terminal α/β/α domains, a linker region, followed by a C-terminal 'swivel' domain with a β/β/α structure (1-2-3-linker-4), although mAcn is smaller than cAcn. However, bacterial AcnB has a different organisation: it contains an N-terminal HEAT-like domain, followed by the 'swivel' domain, then the three α/β/α domains (HEAT-4-1-2-3) [[cite:PUB00005471]]. Eukaryotic cAcn enzyme balances the amount of citrate and isocitrate in the cytoplasm, which in turn creates a balance between the amount of NADPH generated from isocitrate by isocitrate dehydrogenase with the amount of acetyl-CoA generated from citrate by citrate lyase. Fatty acid synthesis requires both NADPH and acetyl-CoA, as do other metabolic processes, including the need for NADPH to combat oxidative stress. The enzymatic form of cAcn predominates when iron levels are normal, but if they drop sufficiently to cause the disassembly of the [4Fe-4S]-cluster, then cAcn undergoes a conformational change from a compact enzyme to a more open L-shaped protein known as iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1; or IRE-binding protein 1, IREBP1) [[cite:PUB00036018], [cite:PUB00036019]].

The enzymatic form of cAcn predominates when iron levels are normal, but if they drop sufficiently to cause the disassembly of the [4Fe-4S]-cluster, then cAcn undergoes a conformational change from a compact enzyme to a more open L-shaped protein known as iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1; or IRE-binding protein 1, IREBP1) [[cite:PUB00036018], [cite:PUB00036019]]. As IRP1, the catalytic site and the [4Fe-4S]-cluster are lost, and two new RNA-binding sites appear. IRP1 functions in the post-transcriptional regulation of genes involved in iron metabolism -it binds to mRNA iron-responsive elements (IRE), 30-nucleotide stem-loop structures at the 3' or 5' end of specific transcripts. Transcripts containing an IRE include ferritin L and H subunits (iron storage), transferrin (iron plasma chaperone), transferrin receptor (iron uptake into cells), ferroportin (iron exporter), mAcn, succinate dehydrogenase, erythroid aminolevulinic acid synthetase (tetrapyrrole biosynthesis), among others. If the IRE is in the 5'-UTR of the transcript (e.g. in ferritin mRNA), then IRP1-binding prevents its translation by blocking the transcript from binding to the ribosome. If the IRE is in the 3'-UTR of the transcript (e.g. transferrin receptor), then IRP1-binding protects it from endonuclease degradation, thereby prolonging the half-life of the transcript and enabling it to be translated [[cite:PUB00036021]].
IRP2 is another IRE-binding protein that binds to the same transcripts as IRP1. However, since IRP1 is predominantly in the enzymatic cAcn form, it is IRP2 that acts as the major metabolic regulator that maintains iron homeostasis [[cite:PUB00036012]]. Although IRP2 is homologous to IRP1, IRP2 lacks aconitase activity, and is known only to have a single function in the post-transcriptional regulation of iron metabolism genes [[cite:PUB00036015]]. In iron-replete cells, IRP2 activity is regulated primarily by iron-dependent degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasomal system.
Bacterial AcnB is also known to be multi-functional. In addition to its role in the TCA cycle, AcnB was shown to be a post-transcriptional regulator of gene expression in Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica [[cite:PUB00036016], [cite:PUB00036017]]. In S. enterica, AcnB initiates a regulatory cascade controlling flagella biosynthesis through an interaction with the ftsH transcript, an alternative RNA polymerase sigma factor.  This binding lowers the intracellular concentration of FtsH protease, which in turn enhances the amount of RNA polymerase sigma32 factor (normally degraded by FtsH protease), and sigma32 then increases the synthesis of chaperone DnaK, which in turn promotes the synthesis of the flagellar protein FliC.  AcnB regulates the synthesis of other proteins as well, such as superoxide dismutase (SodA) and other enzymes involved in oxidative stress. 3-isopropylmalate dehydratase (or isopropylmalate isomerase; [intenz:4.2.1.33]) catalyses the stereo-specific isomerisation of 2-isopropylmalate and 3-isopropylmalate, via the formation of 2-isopropylmaleate. This enzyme performs the second step in the biosynthesis of leucine, and is present in most prokaryotes and many fungal species. The prokaryotic enzyme is a heterodimer composed of a large (LeuC) and small (LeuD) subunit, while the fungal form is a monomeric enzyme. Both forms of isopropylmalate are related and are part of the larger aconitase family [[cite:PUB00005471]]. Aconitases are mostly monomeric proteins which share four domains in common and contain a single, labile [4Fe-4S] cluster. Three structural domains (1, 2 and 3) are tightly packed around the iron-sulphur cluster, while a fourth domain (4) forms a deep active-site cleft. The prokaryotic enzyme is encoded by two adjacent genes, leuC and leuD, corresponding to aconitase domains 1-3 and 4 respectively [[cite:PUB00033924], [cite:PUB00016210]]. LeuC does not bind an iron-sulphur cluster. It is thought that some prokaryotic isopropylamalate dehydrogenases can also function as homoaconitase [intenz:4.2.1.36], converting cis-homoaconitate to homoisocitric acid in lysine biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00032014]]. Homoaconitase has been identified in higher fungi (mitochondria) and several archaea and one thermophilic species of bacteria, Thermus thermophilus [[cite:PUB00036023]].  It is also found in the higher plant Arabidopsis thaliana, where it is targeted to the chloroplast [[cite:PUB00082326]]. This superfamily represents the 'swivel' domain found at the C-terminal of eukaryotic mAcn, cAcn/IPR1 and IRP2, and bacterial AcnA, but in the N-terminal region following the HEAT-like domain in bacterial AcnB. This domain has a three layer β/β/α structure, and in cytosolic Acn is known to rotate between the cAcn and IRP1 forms of the enzyme. This domain is also found in the small subunit of isopropylmalate dehydratase (LeuD)."	INTERPRO

Although IRP2 is homologous to IRP1, IRP2 lacks aconitase activity, and is known only to have a single function in the post-transcriptional regulation of iron metabolism genes [[cite:PUB00036015]]. In iron-replete cells, IRP2 activity is regulated primarily by iron-dependent degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasomal system.
Bacterial AcnB is also known to be multi-functional. In addition to its role in the TCA cycle, AcnB was shown to be a post-transcriptional regulator of gene expression in Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica [[cite:PUB00036016], [cite:PUB00036017]]. In S. enterica, AcnB initiates a regulatory cascade controlling flagella biosynthesis through an interaction with the ftsH transcript, an alternative RNA polymerase sigma factor.  This binding lowers the intracellular concentration of FtsH protease, which in turn enhances the amount of RNA polymerase sigma32 factor (normally degraded by FtsH protease), and sigma32 then increases the synthesis of chaperone DnaK, which in turn promotes the synthesis of the flagellar protein FliC.  AcnB regulates the synthesis of other proteins as well, such as superoxide dismutase (SodA) and other enzymes involved in oxidative stress. This entry represents a small family of proteins homologous and likely functionally equivalent to aconitase 1. Members are found, so far in the anaerobe Clostridium acetobutylicum, in the microaerophilic, early-branching bacterium Aquifex aeolicus, and in the halophilic archaeon Halobacterium sp. NRC-1. No member is experimentally characterised."	INTERPRO
